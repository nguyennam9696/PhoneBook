Must have these components prior to starting:
1) Node.js (run our server)
2) Bower (handle front-end packages such as bootstrap and angular)

First Step:
1) Install Express (server side framework) *npm install express*
2) Install nodemon (if make any changes to server code, it will automatically restart) *npm install -g nodemon* 
    Example: nodemon server.js
